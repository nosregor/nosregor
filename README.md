### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrew Rogerson (Werdna Nosregor) and I'm a Fullstack developer. ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a clone of Wunderlist (called Wonderlist) as a side project. I just finished implementing a BE REST API using node.js, express, typescript and mongo. Next, I will implement the FE in react.
